This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app will be a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This app requires React components, working with helper/util functions, and utilizes the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. The app also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
